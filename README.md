# LOLAPIClient

LOLAPIClient is a Swift package that provides a simple async/await API to communicate with a subset of Riot's League of Legends APIs.

## Supported platforms

- [x] macOS
- [ ] iOS *(maybe in the future ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)*

## Goals

- [x] Make a simple SPM based abstraction layer for [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/) based web backends
- [ ] Migrate to only depend on `async-http-client` instead of Vapor
